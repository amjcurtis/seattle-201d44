#### Announcements!

- ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the one day in the entire course that we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
    - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect and refine our thoughts.
    - The labs on each of the next two days are of much lower intensity than the previous ones this week, and easier to work at on your own, leaving you room to get caught up on the Mon-Wed labs.
    - We can now focus more on refactoring working code, to make it more D.R.Y., and also on improving UI/UX.

- At 1:00 today there is a panel with the 401 instructors in the main event space. What questions might you have for them?

- Today's one(two)-on-one meetings currently scheduled:
 
  - 2:00 Ian
  - 2:15 Tanner
  - 2:30 Alexander
  - 2:45 Marino
  - 3:00 Chris
  - 3:15 Dana
  - 3:30 Elizabeth
  - 3:45 Vanessa
  - 4:30
  - 4:45

- We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing very well. Sam, Dario, and the TAs are extremely pleased with how you all help one another.
- It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams, and  a week from tomorrow starting planning on your projects.
- Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 9 of Code 201, students will:

- Have nailed down the functionality of their retail/data/table app, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignments of the previous three days.
- Demonstrate understanding of fundamental CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and on a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of advanced CSS layout principles including fixed vs. liquid layouts, as well as grid systems, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and on a quiz administered in Canvas
