# Class 19 -  Project Week: Milestone 4
## Presentation Prep

Your team should practice their presentation prior to the final presenatation day. This is typically scheduled by the instructional team. During the practice presentation, the instructional team will provide constructive feedback about the flow of the presenation and appearance of the application.

_Why:_
> If there are any issues in functionality or appearance, it is better to catch them ahead of time. This is also an opportunity to view the application as projected on the screens. Evaluate the larger screen size, color changes due to the projector, and overall impact on the user's experience. The practice round will also allow the team to work on the flow of the presenatation as speaking roles are passed from one member to another.

Decide whose computer to use during the presentation and bring that computer to the practice session. Make sure you have any cables or adaptors needed. Test this same computer in the main event space. Test a backup computer as well, just in case.

The presentation should be approximately 15 minutes long, including some time at the end for questions. Present from the deployed site. Each member should introduce themselves with their personal pitch. The "About Us" page provides a great backdrop for this portion of the presentation.

Each member of the team should have a speaking part. It is okay to use notecards if you are nervous about forgetting what to talk about. Some of the areas to discuss include:
- An introduction of the project and the problem domain, including the team's solution
- A demonstration of the application's functionality
- The team's approach to planning and communication throughout the week
- A technical obstacle or two and how those obstacles were overcome
- A portion of the final application that each team member is particularly proud of

In general, do not show code during the presentation unless the audience asks to see it. Have a code editor open just in case though.

The appropriate dress code is business casual - not too formal and not to casual.

In addition to the scheduled practice session, the team is encouraged to continue to practice on their own. Keep track of the time and adjust accordingly. Practice with the microphone (or holding something) to feel comfortable with holding it and practice passing the microphone between team members as you switch speaking roles.

Speak clearly and do not use slang or profanity. Take it seriously and be professional.
